## Who I Am:
I am a researcher in observational astronomy studying actively accreting black holes at the center of small galaxies. We use these as tools of investigating  the role of accretion in the co-evolution of black holes within their host galaxy over cosmic time. I currently work as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois. I received my Ph.D. in Physics from Washington State University in May of 2025.

Currently, I am interested in using Difference Imaging techniques to identify varying active black holes in low-mass galaxies with long baselines of observations. My thesis work involved quantifying the biases of selecting active black holes in local dwarf galaxies using observational data from across the electromagnetic spectrum.
