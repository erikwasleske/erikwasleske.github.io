## Who I Am:
I am a researcher in observational astronomy studying actively accreting black holes at the center of small galaxies. We use these as tools of investigating  the role of accretion in the co-evolution of black holes within their host galaxy over cosmic time. I currently work as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois. I received my Ph.D. in Physics from Washington State University in May of 2025 after completing my undergraduate studies in Physics and Astrophysics in 2019 at the University of Minnesota.

Currently, I am interested in using variability to identify active black holes in next-generation observatories. My thesis work involved quantifying the biases of selecting active black holes in local dwarf galaxies using observational data from across the electromagnetic spectrum.
